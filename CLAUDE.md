# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current State

**v0.3.3 released** — Portable Library milestone shipped: `tome.lock` lockfile, per-machine preferences via `machine.toml`, `tome update` command with lockfile diffing and interactive triage, connector architecture with data-driven targets. Unified home directory restructured to `~/.tome/`. Next up: **v0.4.1 Browse + Validation** (`tome browse`, `tome lint`, frontmatter parsing) and **v0.4.2 Format Transforms** (rules/instructions syncing, pluggable transform pipeline, Copilot/Cursor/Windsurf format support).

## Project & Task Workflow

- Tasks and roadmap tracked via **GitHub Issues** with milestones (v0.4.1, v0.4.2, v0.5, etc.)
- Project board: **"tome Execution Board"** on GitHub Projects
- Labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `architecture`, `testing`, `documentation`, `dependencies`
- Workflow: check open issues → create feature branch linked to issue → draft PR → CI must pass → merge

## Tech Stack

Rust edition 2024. Key crates: `clap` (CLI), `dialoguer` (interactive prompts), `indicatif` (progress bars), `tabled` (table output), `walkdir` (dir traversal), `sha2` (hashing), `serde`/`toml` (config). Test crates: `assert_cmd`, `tempfile`, `assert_fs`.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
make build          # cargo build
make test           # cargo test (unit + integration)
make lint           # cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make fmt            # cargo fmt
make fmt-check      # cargo fmt -- --check
make ci             # fmt-check + lint + test (matches CI pipeline)
make install        # install binary via cargo install
make build-release  # cargo build --release (LTO + strip)
make release VERSION=0.1.4  # bump version, PR, merge, tag, push (triggers CI release)
```

Run a single test:
```bash
cargo test test_name                          # by test function name
cargo test -p tome -- discover::tests        # module-scoped in a crate
cargo test -p tome --test cli                # integration tests only
```

## Architecture

> For the full deep-dive, see `docs/src/architecture.md`.

Rust workspace (edition 2024) with a single crate:

### `crates/tome` — CLI (`tome`)
The main binary. All domain logic lives here as a library (`lib.rs` re-exports all modules) with a thin `main.rs` that parses CLI args and calls `tome::run()`.

**Sync pipeline** (`lib.rs::sync`) — the core flow that `tome sync` and `tome init` both invoke:
1. **Discover** (`discover.rs`) — Scan configured sources for `*/SKILL.md` dirs. Two source types: `ClaudePlugins` (reads `installed_plugins.json`) and `Directory` (flat walkdir scan). First source wins on name conflicts; exclusion list applied.
2. **Consolidate** (`library.rs`) — Two strategies based on source type: managed skills (ClaudePlugins) are symlinked from library → source dir (package manager owns the files); local skills (Directory) are copied into the library (library is the canonical home). A manifest (`.tome-manifest.json`) tracks SHA-256 content hashes for idempotent updates: unchanged skills are skipped, changed skills are re-copied or re-linked.
3. **Distribute** (`distribute.rs`) — Push library skills to target tools via symlinks in each target's skills directory. Skills disabled in machine preferences are skipped.
4. **Cleanup** (`cleanup.rs`) — Remove stale entries from library (skills no longer in any source), broken symlinks from targets, and disabled skill symlinks from target directories. Interactive in TTY mode; auto-removes with warning otherwise.

**Other modules:**
- `wizard.rs` — Interactive `tome init` setup using `dialoguer` (MultiSelect, Input, Confirm, Select). Auto-discovers known source locations (`~/.claude/plugins/cache`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`).
- `config.rs` — TOML config at `~/.tome/tome.toml`. `Config::load_or_default` handles missing files gracefully. All path fields support `~` expansion.
- `manifest.rs` — Library manifest (`.tome-manifest.json`): tracks provenance, content hashes, and sync timestamps for each skill. Provides `hash_directory()` for deterministic SHA-256 of directory contents.
- `doctor.rs` — Diagnoses library issues (orphan directories, missing manifest entries, broken legacy symlinks) and missing source paths; optionally repairs.
- `status.rs` — Read-only summary of library, sources, targets, and health. Single-pass directory scan for efficiency.
- `lockfile.rs` — Generates and loads `tome.lock` files. Each entry records skill name, content hash, source, and provenance metadata. Uses atomic temp+rename writes.
- `machine.rs` — Per-machine preferences (`~/.config/tome/machine.toml`). Tracks a `disabled` set of skill names and a `disabled_targets` set of target names. Uses atomic temp+rename writes.
- `update.rs` — Implements `tome update`: loads the previous lockfile, diffs against current state, presents changes interactively, and offers to disable unwanted new skills.
- `paths.rs` — Defines `TomePaths` (bundles `tome_home` and `library_dir` to prevent parameter swaps). Also provides symlink path utilities: resolves relative symlink targets and checks symlink destinations.

## Key Patterns

- **Two-tier model**: Sources →(consolidate)→ Library →(distribute)→ Targets. The library is the source of truth. Managed skills (from package managers) are symlinked from library → source dir; local skills are copied into the library. Distribution to targets uses Unix symlinks (`std::os::unix::fs::symlink`) pointing into the library. Unix-only.
- **Targets are data-driven**: `config::targets` is a `BTreeMap<TargetName, TargetConfig>` — any tool can be added as a target without code changes. The wizard uses a `KnownTarget` registry for auto-discovery of common tools.
- **`dry_run` threading**: Most operations accept a `dry_run: bool` that skips filesystem writes but still counts what *would* change. Results report the same counts either way.
- **Error handling**: `anyhow` for the application. Missing sources/paths produce warnings (stderr) rather than hard errors.

## Testing

> For test architecture details, see `docs/src/test-setup.md`.

Unit tests are co-located with each module (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`). Integration tests in `crates/tome/tests/cli.rs` exercise the binary via `assert_cmd`. Tests use `tempfile::TempDir` for filesystem isolation — no cleanup needed.

## CI

GitHub Actions runs on both `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`: fmt check, clippy with `-D warnings`, tests, and release build.

## Releases

Releases are managed by [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/). The release workflow (`release.yml`) is **generated and owned by cargo-dist** — don't edit it manually.

**Important:** When bumping `cargo-dist-version` in `Cargo.toml`, always run `cargo dist init` afterwards to regenerate `release.yml`. We use `allow-dirty = ["ci"]` to tolerate Dependabot action bumps, but cargo-dist upgrades may require real workflow changes that won't be applied automatically.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
